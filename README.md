## 🧪 Passwords Tested

| Password             | Components                                | Strength (%) | Evaluation Summary                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------- |
| `apple123`           | Lowercase + numbers                        | 37%          | Weak - Predictable, lacks complexity    |
| `Apple@123`          | Mixed case + symbol + numbers              | 81%          | Moderate - Decent structure             |
| `P@ssW0rd2025!`      | Complex pattern, 12 characters             | 100%         | Very  Strong - Good mix, slightly common|
| `abcdefgh`           | Only lowercase letters                     | 0%           | Very Weak - Lacks variety               |
| `#HkT$9rTz*Lp@2025`  | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols     | 100%         | Very Strong - High entropy and length   |

## ✅ Key Observations
- Longer passwords are significantly harder to crack.
- Complexity improves resistance against brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Avoid using common patterns or real words.

## 💡 Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Minimum of 12 characters.
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words or reused credentials.
- Use a password manager to store strong passwords securely.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) whenever possible.

## 🛡 Common Password Attack Types

| Attack Type         | Description                                                                    | Defense Tips                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries all possible character combinations.                                     | Use long, complex passwords; implement rate limits/CAPTCHAs   |
| **Dictionary**      | Tries common words and known passwords from lists.                             | Avoid common words, use unpredictable combinations            |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked credentials from past breaches on other sites.                | Use unique passwords for each site; enable MFA                |

## 📘 Conclusion
Password strength plays a critical role in cybersecurity. Using complex, unique passwords and understanding attack vectors like brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing helps strengthen account security.
